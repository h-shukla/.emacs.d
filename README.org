* What it is?
  My personal Emacs Configuration
* How did it came to be?
  Initially it started by watching the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6iY_1aMzeg&list=PLX2044Ew-UVVv31a0-Qn3dA6Sd_-NyA1n][Uncle Dave's Emacs videos]]. But after some
  time of using it I think I have made enough transformations to call it my own
  now.
* Can you use it?
  Of course you can! Just make sure you have Emacs version 26+
* How to use it?
  Clone this repository and place it in home directory as *.emacs.d* then open
  up emacs and the changes should be visible
